The Pizza Order Project is a JavaFX-based application designed to streamline the process of ordering pizzas. Users can customize their pizza by selecting various options such as size (small, medium, large), type of crust, and toppings (e.g., cheese, pepperoni, vegetables). The user interface is intuitive, with dropdown menus, checkboxes, and buttons to make the ordering process simple and efficient. Once the order is configured, the application calculates the total price and displays a summary of the order. This project demonstrates core JavaFX concepts like event handling, layout management, and user interaction while offering a practical solution for pizza ordering.
